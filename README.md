# ZIGIT-part2

This is part 2 = front with my own backend.

**email: test@test.com, password: Test1234**

Backend - Node JS. 
Fronend - React . 
NOTES:
- The server will run on http://localhost:9090. It has 2 end points: 
1. /login - this has a 'get' req , so you'll see data.
2. /projects/:id - it doesn't has a get req, but obviousley was checked with Postman.

- In the file index.js, i put the default Mongo's server: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ZigitNesel.
